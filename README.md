COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python

## Introduction

I worked with COVID-19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in each Country. Also  I used another dataset consist of various life factors scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are living in that country.

## Objectives
* Importing COVID19 dataset and preparing it for the analysis by dropping columns and aggregating rows.
* Finding and calculating a good measure for the analysis.
* Merging two datasets and finding correlations among the datasets.
* Visualizing analysis results using Seaborn. 

## Results
